# agnoster-no-powerline.zsh-theme

This is a small modification to [agnoster's excellent zsh theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme), that looks slightly worse in exchange not requiring the a custom Powerline-patched font to use. I mostly made this becuase I didn't like the fact that the copied text from my zsh sessions wasn't portable. It would show up with missing-glyph symbols when you paste it into Slack, Gist, email, etc. This version solves that, and also has the added benefit of not having to install a custom font to use: it works with zsh out of the box.

The only change from the original is that it gets rid of the fancy arrow separator, and replaces the branch symbol with "âŽ‡" (U+2387 ALTERNATIVE KEY SYMBOL). All the other symbols were already standard Unicode, surprisingly.

Here's what it looks like in macOS Terminal.app, with Menlo and the Solarized Dark theme:
